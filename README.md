<h1> GUI made in Tkinter and Python by me :) </h1>

<h2> Notes to reader </h2>

Code partially derived from https://pythonprogramming.net/tkinter-depth-tutorial-making-actual-program/, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7546050/switch-between-two-frames-in-tkinter and my GTIN-8 project, however most of the code was made by me and only me :)
I used these resources for an introduction to tkinter and object oriented programming.

<h3 id="#Starting page"> Starting page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/starting_page.PNG">
The starting page includes two buttons which lead to the login page and register page respectively.
I will make it look more aesthetically pleasing later :)

<h3 id="#Login Page"> Login page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/login_page.PNG">
Login page where you can enter the loging things and an algorithm will check against existing users and passwords
in user_data.txt; if you don't enter anything or the things are wrong you will not proceed and will receive a pop-up
message saying that you couldn't login.

<h3 id="#Register Page"> Register page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/register_page.PNG">
Register button will write the things in user_data unless the username already exists. If the username already exists
or you don't enter anything you will get a popup message and won't be registered

<h3 id="#Menu Page"> Menu page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/menu_page.PNG">

<h3 id="#Product Page"> Products page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/products_page.PNG">
Essentially main page where you can see products. You can also click on them to see their procedurally created page where you buy, delete or resupply them. 

<h3 id="#Supplier Page"> Supplier page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/supply_page.PNG">
Where you add products. If you dont enter anything, don't enter 1 field, description too short, name too long, etc... then you get a popup error.

<h3 id="#Cart Page"> Cart page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/cart_page.PNG">
Where you finalize orders and subtract amount bought to current stock in

<h3 id="#Model Item Page"> Model Item page </h3>
<img src="https://github.com/hoodlie/tkinter-GUI/blob/master/screenshots/mode_page.PNG">
Where you buy, delete (X) or resupply items (+).
